### Background

FeedHenry was initially built by a mobile application services company of the
same name based in Waterford, Ireland. In September 2014, Red Hat acquired
FeedHenry, and in keeping with their [philosophy](http://community.redhat.com/software/),
began the process of open-sourcing the platform. With the acquisition,
FeedHenry's supported offerings released under the
[Red Hat Mobile Application Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform)
brand and the "FeedHenry" name was retained for releasing related open source
projects.

### What is FeedHenry?

FeedHenry is a cloud-based enterprise mobile application platform that enables
users to design, develop, deploy and manage applications for mobile devices.
The platform specializes in extending enterprise systems to mobile devices,
and provides mobile-specific services for security, notifications and
data synchronization. Developers can easily build backend logic that supports
their mobile applicationsâ€”all in a secure, scalable manner.

### Projects

For most of its life, FeedHenry has been a closed-source SaaS product. Therefore
the open-sourcing process has been gradual. Here are the components that make up
FeedHenry:
