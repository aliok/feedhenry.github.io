Last June, we announced the availability of version 4.0 of our product. This was
the culmination of months of hard work and demonstrated our constantly expanding
set of capabilities. I went on to recap the key technology choices made over
five years ago, choices that proved to be visionary for our mobile platform’s
architecture and functionality: Node.js and containers. We are very proud of our
accomplishments with Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.0 and the new
technologies we introduced to our  Mobile Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS)
component.

Well, now we are back again with another major announcement. Not only have we
provided new underlying technologies for the important MBaaS component, but
today, with version 4.2, we are launching our Core Mobile Application Platform
running on the same foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat
OpenShift Container Platform, leveraging docker formatted containers and
Kubernetes orchestration for our entire product’s infrastructure. Starting
today, we have a full Mobile Application Platform that can be installed
on-premise, in private clouds or in public clouds and is fully supported from
the ground up by our world-class Red Hat support team.
